<h2>How to get a better location</h2>

<p>
You MUST have a working network connection.
</p>

<p>
You MUST have active locations.<br/>
Settings > Location : on
</p>

<p>
You SHOULD use Wifi for getting a location.<br/>
Settings > Location > Mode : a setting with Wifi
</p>

<p>
You SHOULD let the phone use Wifi to scan for location all the time.<br/>
Settings > Wifi > Advanced > Scanning always available : on
</p>

<p>
You SHOULD NOT queue background data (if available).<br/>
Settings > Power management > Queue background data : off (option not available on all mobiles)
</p>

<br/>

<p>
You COULD TRY turn off the Wifi optimization.<br/>
Settings > Wifi > Advanced > Wi-Fi optimization : off
</p>
<p>
You COULD TRY to turn on Wifi briefly, especially if you don't use Wifi otherwise.<br>
(We've noticed that in some cases this helps to get the location service running.)
